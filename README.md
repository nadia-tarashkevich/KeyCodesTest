**Dump key codes (Idea plugin)**

*This IDEA plugin could be useful for exotic keyboards.*

Whenever it is not clear, what exactly the certain key press does on the certain hardware,
and how IDEA receives it, you can launch this plugin, and share the results with the Support. The plugin
is a part of your IDE, runs with the same Runtime environment and receives exactly the same key presses
as IDEA does.

To launch the plugin, install it and go to main menu `View | Tool windows | Dump key codes`.
